    "sponsor_summary_textbox": "On behalf of the study Sponsor, HRA Inc, we would like to resubmit a substantial amendment application previous ethics (11/HRA/HDR5 and 16/HP/0219) to Study FR-WEAD-ED: 1. We have updated some names in positions within Fundicó to reflect staff changes. 2. We have extended the provisional end date for the project. 3. We have explicitly added that we can link health data to data which is likely to impact on acute admissions, to understand the wider determinants of health. This includes data such as air quality, pollen counts, and experimental data from laboratory studies, assessing inflammation, for example. We already feel this is part of our remit and have supported data applications which have requested health data linked to air pollution, for example. However, we wished to add this explicitly to the protocol. 4. After some enquiries about whether a dataset requested from HRA can be exclusively “owned” by a requestor, we have added an explicit statement to our protocol that HRA data will be non-exclusive and that we may curate similar or even the same dataset for other researchers. This is to support open, reproducible science, where researchers can check and build on other people’s findings. This is in line with the FAIR principles of data used in science (that the data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable (able to be linked to other data) and Reusable). 5. Explicitly stated that data processing and storage can occur both on-premise and in Data Controller cloud services, reflecting HRA's move to cloud processes. The cloud services are equally as secure as on premise facilities and reduce the need for sending data to other centres for analysis, as we can offer secure analytical environments which remain under the Data Controller. a) We have made the role of the Data Trust Committee Chair clearer in the protocol, including who can hold this role. After discussion with the DMC members, they have asked for their names not to be on the public HRA website, and we have changed the text in the protocol to reflect this. b) We have updated the composition of the HRA Oversight Group, to reflect how it operates after our experiences to date. c) We have updated the Strategy Executive Group to reflect its current operations - ICF Parent/Legal Guardian V2.4 dated 05Dec2025: in Tables 1, 2 and 3 technical errors were removed and superscript references for additional information provided under these tables were corrected. ICF is now version 2.4 dated 19Jan2026.
