  Scenario Outline: Verify the user is able to sort the manage users list by ascending and descending order for each table column
    When I click the '<Sort_Button>' button on the 'Manage_Users_Page'
    And I capture the page screenshot
    Then I can see the 'manage users' list sorted by '<Initial_Sort>' order of the '<Sort_Field>' on the 'first' page
    When I am on the 'last' page and it should be visually highlighted to indicate the active page the user is on
    And I capture the page screenshot
    Then I can see the 'manage users' list sorted by '<Initial_Sort>' order of the '<Sort_Field>' on the 'last' page
    When I click the '<Sort_Button>' button on the 'Manage_Users_Page'
    And I capture the page screenshot
    Then I am on the 'first' page and it should be visually highlighted to indicate the active page the user is on
    And I can see the 'manage users' list sorted by '<Secondary_Sort>' order of the '<Sort_Field>' on the 'first' page
    When I am on the 'last' page and it should be visually highlighted to indicate the active page the user is on
    And I capture the page screenshot
    Then I can see the 'manage users' list sorted by '<Secondary_Sort>' order of the '<Sort_Field>' on the 'last' page
